    "In Python, the Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions. When you create a custom exception, you need to subclass Exception or one of its subclasses so that your custom exception can inherit the behavior and attributes of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions is a good practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from Exception allows your custom exception to behave like a standard exception in terms of its usage, handling, and propagation. By following the same design pattern as the built-in exceptions, your custom exception will be easier to understand and use for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exception class provides many methods and attributes that can be useful when working with exceptions, such as __str__ for generating a string representation of the exception, args for storing any arguments passed to the exception, and with_traceback for associating a traceback with the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclassing Exception allows you to define more specific exceptions for your code, which can improve the clarity and readability of your error messages. For example, if you're creating a custom exception for a network error, you could subclass Exception as NetworkError to make it clear what kind of error has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions is a good practice because it allows your custom exceptions to behave like standard exceptions, provides useful methods and attributes, and improves the clarity and readability of your error messages.\n",
